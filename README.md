# Object-Detection
This program finds an object inside an image using template matching. 

There are several methods of template matching written as a comment in the code. 
This code uses only one of those methods to detect the object.
The way to use the other methods is written in the code as a comment. Therefore, the comments in this code are equally important to be paid attention.

This code only marks out a part the same image given as an input.
The code uses two python libraries (cv2 and matplotlib).
